# Interface: Disposable

An object that performs a cleanup operation when `.dispose()` is called.

Some examples of how disposables are used:

* An event listener that removes itself when `.dispose()` is called.
* The return value from registering a provider. When `.dispose()` is called, the provider is unregistered.
