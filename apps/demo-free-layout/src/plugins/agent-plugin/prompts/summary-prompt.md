Your task is to create a detailed summary of the conversation so far, focusing on workflow editor operations.

Your summary should include:

1. **Primary Request**: The user's main goal with the workflow editor
2. **Completed Actions**: List all completed workflow operations:
   - Nodes created (with names and types)
   - Edges/connections added
   - Node configurations changed
   - Nodes deleted or modified
3. **Current Workflow State**: Brief description of the current workflow structure
4. **Errors and Fixes**: Any errors encountered and how they were resolved
5. **Pending Tasks**: Unfinished tasks the user explicitly requested
6. **All User Messages**: List all non-tool user messages verbatim (critical for understanding intent)
7. **Current Work**: What was being worked on immediately before this summary

Be concise but preserve all technical details. Output in the following format:

<summary>

1. Primary Request: [description]

2. Completed Actions:
   - [action 1]
   - [action 2]

3. Current Workflow State: [description]
